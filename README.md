# Star-Citizen-DEVS-Recommended-File-Deletion

In this program you will have immediate deletion of the folders Star Citizen Requires you to delete after and update OR if you are experiencing BUGS this is also recommended doing by the Devs.

I made this for ease of life because apparently Star Citizen devs can't program the game to do it themselves.

What does this do you ask, THAT'S SIMPLE.

It deletes ALL shaders and ALL Necessary files and folders out of the USER folder, LEAVING your Star Citizen settings and key binds alone.

DRAW BACK,

Because people have diff install locations, AT THIS TIME you have to edit the file and replace the locations on your computer below the "::Change the location for your game between the quotes below." area.

This will make sure the files point to the correct location of your game installation.

I will be making this so that DOESN'T need to happen but I have to go back to my DOS books and remember how to make it happen. Until then, you will have to edit it yourself OR until Star Citizen Devs actually get around and actually Implement this small tool into there coding themselves.

UNTIL Star Citizen can implement this themselves, ENJOY a way to handle it yourself FREELY without MUCH effort so you can delete what is necessary and go automatically for the most part.
