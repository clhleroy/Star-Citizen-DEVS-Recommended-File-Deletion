# Star-Citizen-DEVS-Recommended-File-Deletion

in this program you will have imediate deletion of the folders Star Citizen Requires you to delete after and update OR if you are experiancing BUGS this is also recomend to do by the Devs.

I made this for ease of life because aparently Star Citizen devs can program the game to do it themselves.

What does this do you ask, THATS SIMPLE.

It deletes ALL shaders and ALL NESSISSARY files and folders out of the USER folder, LEAVING your Star Citizen settings and keybinds alone.

DRAW BACK,

Because people have diff install locations, AT THIS TIME you have to edit the file and replace the locations on your computer below the "::Change the location for your game between the quotes below." area.

This will make sure the files point to the correct location of your game instalation.

I will be making this so that DOESN'T need to happen but I have to go back to my DOS books and rememimber how to make it happen. Until then you will have to edit it yourself OR until Star Citizen Devs acualy get around and acually IMPLIMENT this small tool into there coding themselves.

UNTIL Star Citizen can impliment this themselves, ENJOY a way to handle it yourself FREELY without MUCH effort so you can delete what is nesssissary and go.
